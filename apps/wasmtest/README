This demonstrates RTcmix running the browser, via WebAssembly and the Web Audio API.

Pre-compiled WASM + glue JS is included, so you can try it out without compiling.

Note that you will need to run a local webserver due to security restrictions on file:// URLs.
(e.g. run `python3 -m http.server` in this directory, then open http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.)

You can build this example as follows:

1. Set BUILDTYPE to WASM in rtcmix/site.conf.

2. Setup [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).

3. From the repo root: `emconfigure ./configure; emmake make && emmake make install`.

4. `cd apps/wasmtest; emmake make`
