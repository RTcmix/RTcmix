This gives a very brief summary of new things for each stable version.
If you want more detail, see the ChangeLog.

RTcmix version 5.0
------------------

Includes support for new struct and map objects.  New mfunction type allows
builtin functions to be stored as a variable.

RTcmix version 4.1
------------------

Includes new CHAIN instrument, for creating "super instruments" that comprise
a chain of several instruments. Also merges the formerly separate support for 
rtcmix~ and iOS into the main source tree. Contains many years of other
improvements as well.


RTcmix version 4.0
------------------

Includes a major new set of features to enable dynamic parameter
updates.  Major internal reorganization and stability improvements.
Several new instruments.


RTcmix version 3.8
------------------

Includes a new way to access audio hardware that is more flexible and
reliable.  Support for the ALSA driver on Linux.  Support for 24-bit
files.


RTcmix version 3.6
------------------

Some new instruments, many bug fixes and some internal re-design work.


RTcmix version 3.4
------------------

Includes an imbeddable RTcmix object and sample programs that use it.
This lets you imbed RTcmix into another program and make instrument
calls and update parameters interactively.  Also includes some new
instruments, makegen table-processing functions and many bug fixes.


RTcmix version 3.2
------------------

RTcmix version 3.2 has many bug fixes and a few new instruments and
features.  It now supports the FreeBSD operating system.


RTcmix version 3.1
------------------

RTcmix version 3.1 adds bug fixes, new features, new instruments,
and support for Mac OS X.  (See ChangeLog.)  One new feature --
the pgen Minc call and friends -- is still somewhat experimental.
See docs in insts.vccm for info on using this.  This does not
yet work in OS X.


RTcmix version 3.0
------------------

In addition to many bug fixes, RTcmix version 3.0 adds a major feature:
the ability to route signals between instruments and to multiple outputs.
You set up the bus routing for each instrument using a new Minc call,
bus_config. See "docs/README.bus_config" for explanation.

A new instrument, MIXN, takes full advantage of the multiple-output
capability.

Instrument designers should see "docs/README.inst_porting" to find out
how to make your instruments compatible with this version of RTcmix.

Later 3.0 versions add support for alternative parsers: Perl and Python.
