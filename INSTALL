Here is how to install RTcmix and its instrument packages.

If you have trouble, please join the rtcmix-discuss mailing list
<http://music.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/rtcmix-discuss>, and 
ask for help.


1. Download RTcmix-[version].tar.gz and unpack it anywhere you like (in your
   home directory, or in /usr/local/src, for example) by typing

      tar xfz RTcmix-[version].tar.gz
      (or: gunzip -c RTcmix-[version].tar.gz | tar xf - )


2. cd into the top level of the RTcmix directory, and run the configure script:

      ./configure

   There are some options you might want to give this script. Here's a
   description of them. If you already ran configure without the options,
   it's okay to run it again with the options you want.
 
      --with-alsa       Use the ALSA driver, rather than OSS, on Linux
                        (ignored on macOS)
      --with-fftw       Use the FFTW3 library, instead of the builtin FFT code
      --with-jack       Enable support for the JACK sound server
      --with-multithread=THREADCOUNT  Build multi-threaded RTcmix on Linux or
                        macOS (=THREADCOUNT optional, default=2)
      --with-netplay    Enable code that lets you play RTcmix over a network
      --with-osc        Compile support for receiving OSC (Open Sound Control)
      --with-perl       Build the Perl-enabled RTcmix (PCMIX)
      --with-python     Build the Python-enabled RTcmix (PYCMIX)

   If you have more than one version of Perl or Python on your system, you
   can tell RTcmix which one to use by giving its path with the option, e.g.:

      --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python

   Give these options in any order, following the configure script name:

      ./configure --with-alsa --with-perl --with-python

   NOTE: If you're running macOS earlier than 10.3 and want to enable
   Python, see the instructions below.

   For additional configure options, run "./configure --help". Some of the
   standard GNU options are not yet enabled for RTcmix.

   If you want to use the optional FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)
   support, you must install the fftw3f library that is part of the fftw
   package (see fftw.org). Configure this package with "--enable-float"
   before making and installing. Configure RTcmix with "--with-fftw".

   If you want to use the optional OSC (Open Sound Control) support, you must
   install the liblo library <http://plugin.org.uk/liblo>. On macOS, configure
   this library with "--disable-ipv6".

   To build RTcmix with FFTW, Jack or liblo support, you must have the pkgconfig
   package installed. Any recent Linux distribution has this, but macOS doesn't.
   Get it from Brew, Fink, or DarwinPorts, or compile it from source:
   <https://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/>. If the configure script
   complains about not finding the pkg-config script, try invoking the
   configure script this way:

      PKG_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/pkg-config ./configure --with-[whatever] etc.

   substituting the actual location of pkg-config on your system for the
   "/usr/local/bin" above.


3. There are some special settings that you can make in the "site.conf" file,
   though most people will never need to do this.


4. Make the package. Be sure you're still in the top RTcmix directory and type:

      make


5. If the package builds without errors, install it:

      make install


6. Add the bin directory inside of the RTcmix directory to your $PATH. For
   example, if you're using the bash shell, put something like this in .profile:

      PATH="/path/to/rtcmix/bin:$PATH"
      export PATH


7. Try running some of the scores in docs/sample_scores. To run any score,
   type "CMIX < scorefile.sco". If these seem to work, your installation
   is probably ok.


See the README files in the docs dir for information on recent features.

Platform Notes


Linux
-----

   - Some Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu) do not include all the 
     development supporting files that you need to build RTcmix. You have
     to install these packages before trying to build RTcmix. Specifically,
     you need to install flex and bison, as well as the ALSA header files,
     and probably also the X11 header files. If you want to build the Python
     extension for RTcmix, you also must install python-dev and libssl-dev.
     Currently, RTcmix works with Python 2.7, but not with Python 3. Install
     any of these packages using "sudo apt-get install PACKAGE", where
     PACKAGE is "bison", or "python-dev", etc.

   - If you configure --with-alsa and the output of the configure command
     includes...

        checking alsa/asoundlib.h usability... no
        checking alsa/asoundlib.h presence... no
        checking for alsa/asoundlib.h... no
        configure: WARNING: ALSA asoundlib.h not present; using OSS instead of ALSA
        checking for snd_pcm_open in -lasound... no
        configure: WARNING: ALSA library not present; using OSS instead of ALSA
        configure: creating ./config.status

     then you need to install the ALSA development headers. For Ubuntu, the
     incantation is: sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev.

   - If you are set up to use ALSA, but you see this message when running
     a score...

        *** FATAL ERROR [rtsetparams]:  AudioDevice: This format conversion is currently not supported!

     then it probably means you need to specify the "plughw" audio device.
     Put this line in your ~/.rtcmixrc:

        device = "plughw"


macOS
-----

   - You must use macOS 10.10 or later, and you must have installed the
     appropriate version of the Developer Tools (currently Xcode 12, available
     to anyone with an Apple ID at https://developer.apple.com/xcode).

   - If you want to use gnuplot with the plottable (and older fplot) script
     functions, you have to install both the command-line gnuplot and the
     AquaTerm program.

     First download the AquaTerm-1.1.1.dmg (or later) binary package from
     http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net, and install the package.

     Then install gnuplot. You can build this from source (v. 4.0 or later,
     see below). An alternative is to use one of several third-party package
     managers that install various Unix programs in macOS. In all cases,
     you install the package manager, and then give some command to install
     gnuplot.

       a. Homebrew (https://brew.sh)

       b. MacPorts (https://macports.org)

       c. Fink (http://finkproject.org) [fink install gnuplot]

     If you want or need to install gnuplot from source, get it here:

          http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files

     Unpack the tarball in /usr/local/src. Build the package like this:

        ./configure --without-x
        make
        sudo make install

     For any of these options, including the binaries, you'll probably have to
     add /usr/local/bin to your shell path. For bash, do something like this
     in your .profile:

        PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}
        export PATH

   - macOS versions up until 10.16 (Big Sur) include Python. When no longer
     included, you'll have to install one. Homebrew (https://brew.sh) is a
     good way to do that.


SGI Irix
--------

   - It's been a long time since any of us have compiled RTcmix on Irix, so
     who knows whether it will work or even build. Let us know what you find.
