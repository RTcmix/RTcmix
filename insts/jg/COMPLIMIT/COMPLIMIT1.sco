/* COMPLIMIT: a compressor-limiter

   p0  = output start time
   p1  = input start time
   p2  = duration
   p3  = gain applied to input before compression (in dB)
   p4  = gain applied to output after compression - "makeup gain" (in dB)
   p5  = attack time (seconds)
   p6  = release time (seconds)
   p7  = threshold (in dBFS)
   p8  = compression ratio - e.g. 20 means 20:1 (100 is infinity)
   p9  = look-ahead time (seconds)
   p10 = peak detection window size (power of 2 <= RTcmix output buffer size)
   p11 = detection type (0: peak, 1: average peak, 2: rms)
   p12 = bypass (1: bypass on, 0: bypass off)
   p13 = input channel  [optional; default is 0]
   p14 = percent output to left channel (0 - 1)  [optional; default is 0.5]

   BUGS:
      - Sometimes the compressor will stay in sustain for too long.
        This happens when the source sound has a long decaying envelope
        where some of the decay is above the threshold.
