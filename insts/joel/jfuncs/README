I've added some new functions to MINC which I find useful. Here is a description
of the new commands and instructions for installing them.

==================================================================================================
TO INSTALL:

1. Copy the jfuncs folder to the top directory of your RTcmix installation.
2. Open a terminal and cd into the jfuncs folder.
3. Type make
4. That's it. To use the functions, include the following command at the top of your RTcmix scorefile:
	load ("path/to/RTcmix/jfuncs/jfuncs.so")
		*obviously replace "path/to/RTcmix" with your actual path to RTcmix! ;)
5. Try the sample files!

===================================================================================================
COMMANDS:

sin(value)		trigonomic sine of the value.
cos(value)		trigonomic cosine of the value.
constrain(test,low,high)			clips the value if it exceeds the range [low-high]
remap(test,low0,high0,low1,high1) 	scales a value from an old range [low0-high0]
									to a new range [low1-high1]
	or: remap(test,low,high)		scales a value in the range [0-1] to the range [low-high]
lowrand()		random linear distribution in the range [0-1] weighted toward low values.
highrand()		random linear distribution in the range [0-1] weighted toward high values.
trirand()		random triangular distribution in the range [0-1] weighted toward center values.
gaussrand()		random Gaussian distribution, aka "Bell Curve", in the range [0-1]

prob()			Mara Helmuth's weighted random distribution algorithm
				This can be called two different ways:
	prob(lowlimit,midpoint,hilimit,tightness)
	
				or Joel Matthys's simplified version, which uses the same algorithm (thanks Mara!)
				but scales it to the range [0-1].
	prob(mid,weight)	
		mid (0-1) is the midpoint of the distribution
		weight (0-1): if weight = 0.5, prob returns a plain random distribution
			if weight > 0.5, values cluster around mid value
			if weight < 0.5, values avoid mid value
