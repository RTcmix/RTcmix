This is an example of an instrument that reads from one channel of the input
sound file and copies it to the output sound file. The comments should explain
most of what you have to do to make an RTcmix processing instrument work.

If you base an instrument on this example, copy the entire directory somewhere
(it doesn't matter where), and modify it as follows...

1) Change the name of the directory to the name of your instrument, which
   should be in all caps, like other RTcmix real-time instruments.
   Likewise change the names of MYINST.cpp and MYINST.h.

2) Replace "MYINST" with your instrument name everywhere in MYINST.cpp and .h.

3) In Makefile, set the "NAME" variable to the name of your instrument.

4) Change package.conf so that it points to the "makefile.conf" in the
   RTcmix distribution. (If you have a lot of instruments in one directory,
   they can share one package.conf. Put it in the directory containing all
   the instrument directories, and change their Makefiles to
   "include ../package.conf". See insts/std for an example.)

5) In "test.sco", change the load statement so that it loads the shared
   lib in your src directory. For example, if your .cpp file is called
   "MYINST.cpp" and its full path is "/home/bubba/src/MYINST/MYINST.cpp",
   then the load statement you must put in all scores that use your
   instrument is:  load("/home/bubba/src/MYINST/libMYINST.so").
