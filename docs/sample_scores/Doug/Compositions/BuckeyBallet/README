This directory has the score (plus sub-files included by the score) for one of my
submissions to the Disquiet Junto project.  Just play the score with CMIX and
it generates the entire piece.  If you tweak the random number for the score,
you can generate an infinite set of "variations" on the piece.  This score does
not make use of any external input soundfiles.
