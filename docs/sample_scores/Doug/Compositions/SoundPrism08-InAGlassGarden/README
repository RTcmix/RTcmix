This directory contains a bunch of RTcmix scores which I used to generate the
intermediate sound files for "In A Glass Garden".  Most of the scores can be
run with the arguments "--seed=NNNN" where NNNN is any number between 0 and
MAXINT.  Every seed will produce a slightly different result.  The scores make
use of a higher-level system of functions I developed to specify chains of
instruments, room characteristics, calls to DMOVE, etc.  All of that is here in
the various .info files

The final set of intermediate files that I generated were later mixed using Logic.
