I would like to thank the folks at 4front Technologies (www.opensound.com)
for providing myself, the VCCM and various other members of the RTcmix
development team with up-to-date drivers and prompt answers to technical
questions. Their drivers work beautifully with RTcmix, which would not be 
where it is today without their help.  Thanks guys.
