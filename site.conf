# Definitions in this file override the ones in defs.conf, which are generated
# by the configure script.  Normally, if you're just building the standalone
# RTcmix for Linux or Mac OS X, you should not need to edit this file.
# Just run the configure script.  (See INSTALL for details.)
#
# If you want to build an RTcmix library for embedding in a Max or Pd external,
# or in an iOS or OpenFrameworks app, set the appropriate platform below.

#==============================================================
# Determine target platform

# Choose whether to build standalone RTcmix or embeddable versions for Max,
# Pd, iOS, OpenFrameworks, etc.  See "README.embed" for more information.

#BUILDTYPE = OSXEMBEDDED
#BUILDTYPE = MAXMSP
#BUILDTYPE = PD
#BUILDTYPE = IOS

# Overrides (please make sure you know what you are doing)

# For OSXEMBEDDED, you can override the default RTLIBTYPE (DYNAMIC) to build a static
# version of the rtcmix library by uncommenting this.  This will not affect
# STANDALONE, MAXMSP, or IOS builds.  PD always builds static.

#RTLIBTYPE = STATIC

# For IOS, you can override the default AUDIODRIVER (APPLE) to build a version of RTcmix
# which uses the embedded audio device to let you call the RTcmix rendering callback
# directly in your environment.  The default APPLE device plays and records audio
# internal to RTcmix.  This will not affect STANDALONE, MAXMSP, or PD builds.

#AUDIODRIVER = EMBEDDEDAUDIO
